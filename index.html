  <h1>Hi welcome to my black hole!</h1>
  <p><em>Pierre de Fermat</em> was a mathematician and scientist. Most famous
  for what he didn't did the "Fermat's last therorem", he has written aside in
  a page the following statement.</p>

  <p>"There aren't any set of positive integers <em>x, y, z and n</em> with 
  <em>n</em> bigger than 2 that satisfies the equation".</p>

  <p>And me? I did nothing. But you can check my workings in 
  <a src="http://github.com/igormorgado/">my GitHub</a>.The ones I'm most
  proud of are (no special order):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>numerico: Codes about numerical analysis and methods. In Python.</li>
    <li>wave: Wave Phenomena simulation. In C</li>
    <li>Seismic: Seismic simulations. In Python</li>
    <li>assetsbrowser: A browser for game assets. In C/Python</li>
    <li>pong: A clone of an very old game. In C.</li>
    <li>factory: A tool to manage source compilation. In Bash.</li>
    <li>liblohs: A driver for optical markers (very old). In C.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That is it.</p>
