I'm following the book *Mimetic Discretization Methods* by Castillo and Miranda, reading the page 209-211, it states the following:

Let $$V(m;G)$$ be a **Vandermonde matrix**, of order $$m$$ with generator $$G = \{ g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n \}$$. Where the order implies the highest power of Vandermonde matrix, therefore $$V(m;G)$$ has $$(m+1)$$ rows and $$n$$ columns. 

Let 

$$
\begin{align}
G_1 &= \{ -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2, 9/2 \} \\
G_2 &= \{ -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, 7/2 \} \\
G_3 &= \{ -5/2, -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 \} \\
G_4 &= \{ -7/2, -5/2, -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2 \}
\end{align}
$$

Generators of the following matrices

$$
\begin{align}
V_1 &=V(4;G_1) \\
V_2 &=V(4;G_2) \\
V_3 &= V(4;G_3) \\
V_4 &= V(4;G_4)
\end{align}
$$

Just for sake of example $$V_1$$ looks like:

$$
\begin{align}
V_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
-1/2 & 1/2 & 3/2 & 5/2 & 7/2 & 9/2 \\
(-1/2)^2 & (1/2)^2 & (3/2)^2 & (5/2)^2 & (7/2)^2 & (9/2)^2 \\
(-1/2)^3 & (1/2)^3 & (3/2)^3 & (5/2)^3 & (7/2)^3 & (9/2)^3 \\
(-1/2)^4 & (1/2)^4 & (3/2)^4 & (5/2)^4 & (7/2)^4 & (9/2)^4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

The null space of this matrix is given by $$Ker(V_1) =[-1 \; 5 \; -10\; 10\; -5\; 1]^T$$, that is easily verifiable just by $$V_1 \cdot Ker(V_1)$$ that results in the null vector, as expected.

The other Vandermonde matrices $$V_2, V_3, V_4$$ share the same null space. The book then states:

> In general, the null space of a $$k$$-th order Vandermonde matrix has dimension $$\frac{1}{2}k -1$$.

**My first question**: There is no references or proofs to support this claim. Is this true? How can I prove that? What are conditions to that be true. I could not find anywhere this affirmation.

The text continues, and we need to solve the following system

$$
\begin{equation}
V_i a_i^T = b
\end{equation}
$$

Where $$V_i$$ are the **Vandermonde** matrices above, $$a_i$$ is a unknown vector and $$b = [ 0 \;1 \;0 \;0\; 0 ]$$

Lets only focus in $$i=1$$ since the construction to other matrices are equivalent. We then need to solve the following:

$$
\begin{equation}
V_1 a_1^T = b
\end{equation}
$$

completely written as

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
-1/2 & 1/2 & 3/2 & 5/2 & 7/2 & 9/2 \\
(-1/2)^2 & (1/2)^2 & (3/2)^2 & (5/2)^2 & (7/2)^2 & (9/2)^2 \\
(-1/2)^3 & (1/2)^3 & (3/2)^3 & (5/2)^3 & (7/2)^3 & (9/2)^3 \\
(-1/2)^4 & (1/2)^4 & (3/2)^4 & (5/2)^4 & (7/2)^4 & (9/2)^4 \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} \\a_{12} \\a_{13} \\a_{14} \\a_{15} \\a_{16}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

Then the text declares that 

$$
\begin{align}
a_1 = \left[ -\frac{11}{12} \, \frac{17}{24} \, \frac{3}{8} \, -\frac{5}{24} \,  \frac{1}{24} \, 0 \right]  + \alpha_1 Ker(V_1)
\end{align}
$$

for some $$\alpha_1 \in \mathbb{R}$$.

**My second question** is: where that vector in first term came from? Is that true? How can I show that?

I'm able to solve that system using least squares, but could not find a correlation.

### Some tries: (EDIT)

Definition (**Null Space**): $$Ker(V)$$ is a null space of $$V$$ if an only if $$V \cdot \alpha Ker(V) = \vec{0}$$ for any $$\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$.

Lets say by hypothesys that

$$
\begin{align}
a &= x + \alpha Ker(V)
\end{align}
$$

Since we are looking for (I will drop the indexes for sake of notation and typing):

$$
\begin{align}
V \cdot a &= b \\
a &= V^{-1} b
\end{align}

$$
by the hypothesis
$$

\begin{align}
x + \alpha Ker(V) &= V^{-1} b \\
Vx + V \left( \alpha Ker(V) \right) &= b
\end{align}

$$
by Null Space definition
$$

\begin{align}
Vx &= b
\end{align}
$$

We are just back where we started, seems a tautology in my view.

Anyway I also know that

$$
\begin{align}
a &= x + \alpha Ker(V) \\
x &= a - \alpha Ker(V)
\end{align}
$$

I can find $$a$$ by least squares, and have $$Ker(V)$$ by the null space analysis. Therefore  I just need to find $$\alpha$$ to uniquely identify $$x$$.
