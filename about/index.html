    <p>Since very young I was fascinated with magic. Each dozen of keystrokes were able to make a mysterious box transform that in many different spells: words, graphs, sounds. All that coming from the marvellous light screen in front of me. While growing up, my interest in how those magic boxes were build and how it communicate with others intrigued me and I had chased that dream. After become a full grown up I have discovered were all real magic came from. They came from transformations of what-so-called numbers and today I'm trying to unveil those mysteries to try to approach to the a single true idea: the whole universe.</p>
